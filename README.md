# Decision Making for Teens 🎓

A practical guide to help teenagers develop strong decision-making skills — navigating school, friendships, social media, career choices, and the transition to adulthood.

## Why Teens Need Decision-Making Skills

The teenage years involve some of life's most impactful decisions — which subjects to study, who to spend time with, whether to take risks, and what path to pursue after school. Yet most education systems never explicitly teach how to think through decisions systematically.

Research shows that the prefrontal cortex (the brain's decision-making center) isn't fully developed until age 25. This means teens are making big decisions with hardware that's still under construction. The good news: structured decision frameworks can compensate for this and build lifelong habits.

## Decision Frameworks for Teens

### 1. The STOP Method (For Quick Decisions)
When you feel pressure to decide quickly:
- **S**top — Pause before reacting. Take a breath.
- **T**hink — What are my options? What could happen?
- **O**bserve — How am I feeling? Am I being pressured?
- **P**roceed — Make a choice you'll be proud of tomorrow.

### 2. The 10-10-10 Rule (For Medium Decisions)
Ask yourself:
- How will I feel about this in **10 minutes**?
- How will I feel about this in **10 months**?
- How will I feel about this in **10 years**?

This helps you zoom out from immediate emotions and see the bigger picture.

### 3. The Decision Journal (For Big Decisions)
For major life choices (college, career, relationships), write down:
1. What you're deciding
2. What options you have
3. What you expect will happen with each option
4. Why you chose what you chose
5. (Later) What actually happened

This builds self-awareness and helps you learn from past decisions.

## Common Teen Decision Areas

### Academic Decisions
- **Course selection**: Choose based on genuine interest AND future utility
- **Study habits**: Quality of focus matters more than hours spent
- **College/career path**: It's okay not to know — focus on keeping options open

### Social Decisions
- **Peer pressure**: Having a pre-decided personal policy makes it easier to say no in the moment
- **Social media**: Set boundaries before you need them, not after
- **Friendships**: You become the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with

### Health & Safety Decisions
- **Risk assessment**: Learn to distinguish calculated risks from reckless ones
- **Substances**: Understand that teenage brains are more vulnerable to addiction
- **Mental health**: Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness

### Financial Decisions
- **Saving vs. spending**: The habit matters more than the amount
- **First job choices**: Prioritize learning over earning early on
- **Understanding compound interest**: Starting early is the biggest advantage

## Mental Traps Teens Should Know About

| Trap | What It Is | How to Counter It |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| FOMO | Fear of missing out drives impulsive choices | Ask: "Will this matter in a month?" |
| Sunk Cost | Continuing something just because you started it | Focus on future value, not past investment |
| Groupthink | Going along with the crowd without thinking | Practice deciding before hearing others' opinions |
| Present Bias | Overvaluing immediate pleasure over future benefit | Use the 10-10-10 rule |
| All-or-Nothing | Thinking one mistake ruins everything | Every day is a new chance to decide better |
